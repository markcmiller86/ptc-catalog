## Using the Catalog

The Progress Tracking Card (PTC) Catalog is a resource intended to provide ease-of-use
and reusability of previously created PTCs. Within this site, you can find
PTCs that can help you to practice better development, planning, performance,
reliability, and collaboration on your scientific software projects.

The catalog can be accessed both in alphabetical and categorized formats. We
encourage you to incorporate your card directly into your project's software
repository.
