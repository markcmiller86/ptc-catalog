## Target

Selecting and Implementing a License for your Software.

## User Story

As a contributor to a software package, I want to ensure that our work has an appropriate software license associated with it so that users and new contributors will understand how the intellectual property is managed.

## Card(s)

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | Software team should agree on key requirements for a license. |
| 1 | For an open source license, identify an Open Source Initiative-approved license that meets your requirements.  For a closed source license, engage a qualified IP or tech transfer professional to design a license meeting your requirements.      |
| 2 | Add a LICENSE file with the text of the license to your code repository.      |
| 3 | Add licensing header to each and every source file<sup>[1]</sup>. |
| 4 | Ensure that you have and maintain contact information for every contributor to the software.     |
