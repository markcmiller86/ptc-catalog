## Target

Create an onboarding process for new team members.

## User Story

As a mentor and/or project leader, I want to have an onboarding process that is used to help new team members 
become contributors to our project using our policies for software development.

## Card

| Stage         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | No onboarding process in place. |
| 1 | Initial onboarding process is documented. The process covers an established time period (pre-arrival, first day, first week, first month, etc.) and includes a checklist of activities. |
| 2 | The team onboarding process is used by supervisors for new hires.|
| 3 | The team onboarding process is approved by HR. Regular reviews of the process are undertaken.|
| 4 | All team members are familiar with, and actively participate in, the onboarding process.|
