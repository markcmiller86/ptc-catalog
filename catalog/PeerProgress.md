## Target

According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans. (Sun Tzu)

## User Story

As a group lead,
I need to stay abreast of current and planned developments in related projects,
so that project efforts can adapt to changing circumstances.

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | No regular literature or news review practices are established. |
| 1 | Team discusses recent project-related developments. |
| 2 | A list has been made of primary peers, journals, conferences, and blogs / social media sources relevant to the project. |
| 3 | Regular reviews of project-related developments are performed, involving RSS where practical. |
| 4 | Evolving capabilities and goals of related efforts are tracked over time. |
| 5 | Team commits to reviewing and suggesting ways to adapt to new developments. |

## Comments

- Knowing about relevant projects not only prevents re-inventing the wheel, it
can also be a source of new collaborators and increased productivity.

- Tracking peer progress looks different in different disciplines, but is especially
important where software development is involved because of the potential win if
datastructures and API-s can be made inter-operable early on.
