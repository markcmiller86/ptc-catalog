# Rate Your Project Survey

Brought you by the [IDEAS-ECP project](https://ideas-productivity.org) and the [PSIP Development Team](https://bssw.io/psip).

## Why are Software Team Practices Important?

Software engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, and maintenance of a software system. Building reliable and maintainable software is difficult and expensive. By adopting a systematic approach to software development, it is possible to maximize the cost effectiveness of the software system.

### Key Objectives of Software Engineering

Objective | Description
:--------:|:-----------
Maintainability | Should be able to evolve to meet changing requirements
Correctness | Correctly implements the user requirements
Adaptability | Can be changed to adapt to new system or user constraints
Reusability | Modules can be readily reused to develop new software products
Testability | Should be testable with minimal effort
Portability | Can be cost effectively transferred from one computer system to another
Reliability | Should be able to perform its desired function over an arbitrary time period

### How Does Your Team Score?

Use the following survey to rate your team practices.

Score | Description
-----:|:-----------
0 | Oh oh. Now is a good time to take a look at PSIP (see below) for identifying and tracking practices that could be used or improved.
<10 | Good start! A process improvement strategy such as PSIP (see below) could be a good way to get you to the next level.
10-100 | Cool! Adopting advanced practices can be challenging without a process improvement strategy such as PSIP (see below.).
100-400 | Impressive! Seems like you have really good practices already in place. Have you thought about how you could improve from here?
\>400 | Wow, you rock! Would you be interested in writing a blog article on your software engineering practices?

### Where To Go Next?

Regardless of your score, there is always room for improvement. One way to improve your projectâ€™s practices is to look at a software improvement strategy, such as the Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP). PSIP is a lightweight process that uses Progress Tracking Cards (PTCs) to track the improvements you are making. Some PTCs related to the survey items can be found on the [Survey PTC Index Page](survey-ptcs.md).

## Project Self-Survey

The form below shows a range of practices that increase in maturity. Check the practices that your project already uses, score each basic practice as 1 point, intermediate as 10 points and advanced as 100 points. Write the score in the box below.
