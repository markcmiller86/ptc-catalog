# Incorporate a Progress Tracking Card into a Software Repository

At PSIP, we believe the best way to keep your progress tracking card on your
team's radar is to incorporate that card into your software development process.
To this end, we recommend:

## Download a Progress Tracking Card

1. Browse the [PTC Catalog](https://bssw-psip.github.io/ptc-catalog/catalog/) and find the card that is right for you **OR** use
the [blank template](/catalog/ProgressTrackingCardTemplate.html)
2. Click the **Download this PTC** button to download the card as a Markdown file
   ![Download File](/ptc-catalog/assets/images/download_file.png)
3. Upload this file to your software repository as:
   - A file
   - An issue
   - A wiki page
   - A GitHub Pages page
   - or more!
4. Regularly refer to your new PTC in team meetings, stand-ups, etc.


## Examples of Incorporation

Depending on your team's preferred version control system, work style, etc.,
there are numerous options on how to incorporate a PTC into your project's
repository. We will provide some examples (in GitHub and GitLab) 
- but feel free to use your new PTC however you see fit!
