# Incorporate a Progress Tracking Card into a Software Repository

At PSIP, we believe the best way to keep your progress tracking card on your
team's radar is to incorporate that card into your software development process.
To this end, we recommend three methods:

## Method 1: Download a Progress Tracking Card

1. Browse the [PTC Catalog](https://bssw-psip.github.io/ptc-catalog/catalog/) and find the card that is right for you **OR** use
the [blank template](/catalog/ProgressTrackingCardTemplate.html)
2. 


## Method 2: Fork the `ptc-catalog` Repository

1. Navigate to the main [`ptc-catalog` repository](https://github.com/bssw-psip/ptc-catalog)
2. In the top-right of the page, click the `Fork` button
   ![Create a Fork](/ptc-catalog/assets/images/fork_button.png)
3. Select your appropriate GitHub organization (or username) for the new fork


## Method 3: Create an Issue Template
